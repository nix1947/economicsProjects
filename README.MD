- **Solvency ratio**
  - solvency ratio is a performance metric that helps us examine a company’s financial health.In particular, it enables us to determine whether the company can meet its financial obligations in the long term.
  
  ```sql 
  Solvency Ratio = (Net Income + Depreciation) / All Liabilities (Short-term + Long-term Liabilities)
 ```
 If you examine keenly, you will notice that the numerator comprises the entity’s current cash flow, while the denominator is made up of its liabilities. Thus, it is safe to conclude that the solvency ratio determines whether a company’s cash flow is adequate to pay its total liabilities
