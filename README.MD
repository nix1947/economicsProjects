- **Solvency ratio**
  - solvency ratio is a performance metric that helps us examine a company’s financial health.In particular, it enables us to determine whether the company can meet its financial obligations in the long term.
  
  ```sql 
  Solvency Ratio = (Net Income + Depreciation) / All Liabilities (Short-term + Long-term Liabilities)
 ```
